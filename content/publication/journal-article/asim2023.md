abstract: Moral mandates place expectations on organizations to address social problems such as equality, diversity, and environmental sustainability. These mandates are inherently ambiguous, as they lack a shared understanding regarding their purpose, scope, and associated practices. They are also often broad and systemic and may be unclearly aligned with an organizationâ€™s strategy. Due to these challenges, in this paper we theorize that collective action at the field level is necessary for organizations to advance and concretize moral mandates, especially in the absence of clear strategic alignment. We examine this theorizing through the case of the implementation of sustainability as a moral mandate in higher education. We hypothesize and find support for the idea that when organizational members engage in collective action at the field level, those organizations have an increased likelihood of achieving sustainability implementation. To gain insight into this field-to-organization relationship, we examine 18 years of conversations from the online forum qualitatively to develop a process model of moral mandate implementation. We theorize that collective action functions as a field-configuring space, in which actors from across a variety of organizations come together to 1) refine the scope of the mandate and 2) create an implementation repertoire that actors can draw on when seeking to bring sustainability to their own organizations. Overall, our study provides a model of how ambiguous moral mandates can be implemented by highlighting the important role of collective action across organizations in concretizing ambiguous moral mandates and providing actors with the tools for their implementation.
